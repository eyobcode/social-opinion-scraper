It’s about creating what isn’t already everywhere. AI can write captions and create content but what it can’t do is live your life or have your unique experiences. THAT’s the advantage now. We have got to go back to basics and share our lived experiences and opinions and perspectives and be 1000% authentic. And the successful creators out there aren’t wondering what to post…they’re living their life and creating content around it. They’re sharing their thoughts, opinions, journeys, etc. So if content feels forced, that’s a sign to regroup ❤️",

Now the feed is ads and the same idea repeated a thousand times because we paused for half a second on one video. Humans are not spreadsheets. You cannot fully predict curiosity, context, or mood. Bring back a chronological feed by default, or at least give it its own tab. Let the algorithm live somewhere optional. Charge advertisers whatever you want, that is your business. Hell, charge users who want pure chronological, some of us would pay just to have our feeds work again. But the current setup is hurting creators, hurting businesses, and exhausting users. Three years of declining engagement did not come out of nowhere. This platform used to feel alive. Right now it feels engineered, noisy, and disconnected from how people actually use it.",

But I think it misses a crucial moment of leadership.You talk about the need to change, about trust, about authenticity, and you point to factors like camera technology, culture and AI too, as forces that shaped where we are. All of that may be true, but what’s missing is clear ownership of Instagram’s role in this and where we are today. For years, this platform has rewarded polish, performance and constant optimisation. Creators learned very quickly what rose and what disappeared, and adjusted their work accordingly. Over time, that pulled both creators and audiences away from authenticity and real human connection.This year’s algorithm changes have gone much further than a shift in reach. They have directly affected people’s livelihoods. Established businesses have seen income drop, work dry up and years of audience-building undermined almost overnight. This is not theoretical or short-term. For many, the impact is ongoing and deeply destabilising.There is also no acknowledgement in your post that AI was pushed into the platform by default, with unclear consent and vague settings. Many people didn’t knowingly opt in, and that has damaged trust in a very real way.This felt like a moment to simply say: Instagram has been a big part of the problem, and we understand why people feel disconnected and frustrated and we’re really sorry. Without that honesty, calls for authenticity risk sounding hollow. Trust isn’t rebuilt with tools or 20 image long explanations. It’s rebuilt when responsibility is owned plainly and publicly and gigantic entities like this one have the balls to apologise ✌🏼",

We also received a DMCA notice at ~05:23 and the account action followed at ~05:35, so there was no meaningful chance to respond.

Ai is hyper accelerating that saturation and is forcing us to adapt and elevate our deductive and curatorial abilities as well as elevate our place as creators and essentially “brands” (for better or worse). Ai will dominate the saturated “content” layer and true creators and artists will stand the test of time as they always have. Everything is a cycle and real, good human creation will be more and more valuable while Ai fills the gaps…And quite simply, Ai is not going anywhere. So creators, whether you augment your abilities with Ai, or create an untouchable lane of pure human creation, it’s time to stop complaining, step up and adapt, . I personally have always hated being labeled a “content creator” by brands that didn’t know better. I’ll leave that content junk to Ai.
